🚀 Building a Small Language Model from Scratch

“I didn’t just use a pre-trained model — I built one from the ground up.”






🌟 Why This Project?

In today’s AI landscape, most people start with Hugging Face models or APIs.
But I wanted to go deeper — to really understand how a language model thinks.

This notebook is the result of hours of coding, debugging, and training on Google Colab T4 GPU.
It wasn’t easy — the runs were slow, memory was limited, and I had to optimize carefully.
But I didn’t quit.

What came out is a miniature language model that learns to read, understand, and generate text — all from scratch, without shortcuts.

📖 What’s Inside the Notebook?

The notebook is not just code.
It’s a guided journey into the internals of a language model:

Data Preparation

Cleaned and tokenized raw text into sequences.

Built a custom vocabulary and embedding layer.

Neural Architecture

Implemented the transformer blocks step by step.

Wrote attention mechanisms from scratch.

Added positional encodings to make sense of word order.

Training Loop

Optimized with AdamW.

Loss monitoring with live green progress bars.

Saved checkpoints and generated intermediate outputs.

Text Generation

Prompted the model with a seed phrase.

Watched it autocomplete and generate surprisingly coherent text.

Visual Insights

Loss curves, attention heatmaps, and output samples.

Every visualization tells a story about how the model learns.

⚡ Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases my ability to:

Understand transformer internals beyond just using libraries.

Implement attention and embeddings from scratch.

Work with limited compute (Colab T4) and still push through.

Debug, optimize, and run long training cycles without giving up.

Recruiters looking at this repo won’t just see code — they’ll see persistence, curiosity, and engineering depth.

🖥️ How to Run

Clone the repo and open the notebook:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/small-language-model-scratch.git
cd small-language-model-scratch
jupyter notebook "Small Language Model Scratch Final.ipynb"


Or run directly on Google Colab (recommended if you don’t have a GPU).

🔮 Future Work

This is just the first milestone.
In the future, I want to:

Train on larger corpora.

Experiment with scaling layers/heads.

Compare with pre-trained Hugging Face models.

Deploy as a mini text-generation API.

❤️ Personal Note

This project was special because it reminded me that AI is not magic.
Behind every giant model, there are small building blocks — embeddings, attention, layers — and I built them myself.

It took patience, compute time, and late nights, but I walked away with true intuition about how language models work.

✨ If you’re a recruiter or collaborator: this isn’t just another NLP project — it’s proof that I can build, persist, and deliver even when the resources are limited.
