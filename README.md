# SMALL-LANGUAGE-MODEL--SLM----FROM-SCRATCH



🧠 Small Language Model from Scratch






📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build a Small Language Model (SLM) completely from scratch.
Instead of relying on large pre-trained models, we implement the fundamental building blocks step by step to understand how a transformer-based LLM works under the hood.

The notebook covers:

Tokenization and text preprocessing

Building embeddings

Implementing attention mechanisms

Training a small transformer

Generating text outputs

This project is meant for learning and research purposes, making LLM internals more accessible to AI enthusiasts.

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository and install required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/small-language-model-scratch.git
cd small-language-model-scratch

# Create environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


💡 Alternatively, open the notebook directly in Google Colab for a zero-setup experience.

🚀 Usage

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook "Small Language Model Scratch Final.ipynb"


Run cells step by step to:

Tokenize and preprocess input text

Train the mini language model

Generate text predictions

Example output:

Input: "Artificial Intelligence is"
Output: "Artificial Intelligence is transforming the way we create and learn."

📊 Visualizations

The notebook includes rich visualizations such as:

Training progress bars (green bars)

Attention heatmaps

Loss curves

Text generation samples

These plots help in understanding the model’s learning behavior.

📖 Learning Objectives

Understand the core components of a language model.

Get hands-on with transformer architecture.

Build intuition for how large-scale LLMs (GPT, Mistral, LLaMA, etc.) are trained.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (NumPy, PyTorch)

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

🌟 Future Work

Add support for larger datasets.

Experiment with scaling the model.

Compare performance with pre-trained Hugging Face models.
